One problem I can connect to is having irregular periods, heavy bleeding  having bad cramps and being in a horrible mood while on my periods.  
The truth is that the doctor said that because this problem with my periods, I may not be able to get pregnant, have trouble getting pregnant, or will end in miscarrige.  
How the situation of having irregular periods could be solved by is eating healthier, sleeping better and putting myself under less stress. 
How the pregancy situation can be solved is by taking a PCOS test and fertility test. How this problem can be solved by using an app, is that the user can enter "irregular periods" or "fertility issues" 
in the search bar and it will give them a variety of situations.
